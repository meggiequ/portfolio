		<h2 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The Redesign of Caltrain Mobile App</h2>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 3em;">Role: UX UI Design, User Research, User Testing | Duration: 3 Months </p>
		
		<div class="stagger-tween">
			<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
			<p>
				As a frequent Caltrain user, I have noticed that the mobile app from Caltrain doesn't meet their customers' needs. And the user experience is poorly designed. Through primary, secondary, and tertiary research, it was suggested that most Caltrain users are disappointed at the current app and turning to services provided by 3rd parties.
			</p>
			<p>
				To solve the problems, I decided to start with a heuristic evaluation of the current app and primary research with the target audience. Having the advantage of taking the Caltrain every week, I was able to observe and talk to many Caltrain riders to understand their pain points, what they need and want. With the insights I focused on three use cases: checking schedules from work to home, adding clipper cash value, and paying for station parking. I started prototyping and testing, after 4 rounds of iterations I reached the final design.
			</p>

			<div class="stagger-tween">
				<h3 class="stagger-tween-item">RESEARCH</h3>
				<p class="stagger-tween-item">
					In my research I read through the reviews in the app store, and putting myself in the shoes of the users to experience it myself. Through interviewing actual users, I got more insights that I have never experienced myself. With secondary research, I understood more about the target audience which helped me make design decisions.

				<h4 class="stagger-tween-item">HEURISTIC EVALUATION</h4>
				<p class="stagger-tween-item">
					To identify the problems, firstly I conducted a heuristic evaluation to measure the efficacy of the design in order to redesign and improve it.

				<div class="three-three stagger-tween-item">
					<h3 class="valuation move-left" style="opacity: 0.6">01</h3>
					<h3 class="valuation" style="opacity: 0.6">FUNCTIONALITY</h3>
					<p>As an official app from Caltrain, users expect certain basic functions and information to help with their travels. However, the app only designed the ticket purchasing function which led to the very low rating of the app, complains in the reviews, and the losing of users.</p>
				</div>
				<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/caltrain-reviews.png">

			<div class="stagger-tween three-three">
				<h3 class="valuation move-left stagger-tween-item" style="opacity: 0.6">02</h3>
				<h3 class="valuation stagger-tween-item" style="opacity: 0.6">CONCEPTUAL MODEL</h3>
				<p class="stagger-tween-item">Current Caltrain app’s design doesn’t bridge the gap between designer’s conceptual model and  user’s mental model. The task flow of the app doesn’t show the understanding of user journey of the target audience. After purchasing a ticket, what’s next? Do users want to know where the stations are? Which trains they can take? When to board and get off the trains?</p>
				<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/caltrain-model.png">
			</div>
			<div class="stagger-tween three-three">
				<h3 class="valuation move-left stagger-tween-item" style="opacity: 0.6">03</h3>
				<h3 class="valuation stagger-tween-item" style="opacity: 0.6">RESPONSIVENESS</h3>
				<p class="stagger-tween-item">It’s shocking to see how Caltrain linked their unresponsive website in the trip planner section. Even though users can zoom in the webpage, it’s extremely difficult to check the schedules in this timetable and plan the trip. A lot of useful information from Caltrain are designed for print and desktop websites. Designers can’t just use them directly without tailoring to mobile devices. In order for users to access the information on the go, contents need to be designed friendly on mobile devices.</p>

				<h3 class="stagger-tween-item">AUDIENCE</h3>
				<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/caltrain-audience.png">
				<p class="stagger-tween-item">As I started my research, firstly I tried to identify Caltrain's target audience. As a Caltrain user myself, I have observed people taking Caltrain everyday. I had a general perception of the users.</p>
				<p class="stagger-tween-item">From Alexa.com I gethered a set of useful demographics data on users who visit Caltrain.com. As Caltrian Mobile has a fairly small user pool, there are not much data generated by 3rd parties. However, Caltrain Mobile users are those who take Caltrain and check Caltrain website.</p>				
				<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/audience-demogra.png">
			</div>
			<div class="stagger-tween">
				<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/audience-survey.png">
				<p class="stagger-tween-item">Apart from 3rd party resources, Caltrain does research and generate reports on thier customers as well. I was able to find a report in 2017 on their customers. Then I created this graph of their customers' demographics.</p>
				<p class="stagger-tween-item">
					Most of the Caltrain riders use Clipper card (52%) and Go passes(21%) when they travel on Caltrain. Among whom, 36% of them travel with monthly passes and 16% of them use Clipper Cash. That left only around a quarter Caltrain riders who need to purchase tickets. Since the only functions Caltrain Mobile app were designed with are purchsing and proving tickets. This explains why so many bad reviews on Caltrain Mobile app are about its functions and not meeting customers' need.

				<h3 class="valuation stagger-tween-item">Audience Interview</h3>
				<br>
				<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/caltrain-interviewee.png">
				<p class="stagger-tween-item">
					To better empathize with users, I conducted a few interviews at train stations and over the phone with caltrain users. I talked to frequent Caltrain riders who take it on a daily basis and also riders who only ride the train occasionally. Then I used affinity diagramming to process the data. 
				</p>
				<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/caltrain-affinity.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="stagger-tween">							
				<p class="stagger-tween-item">For the interviews I asked questions regarding three general categories including their background, experience with Caltrain, and their feedbacks on the app.</p>
				<p class="stagger-tween-item">To Empathize with the users, I also mapped the user journey from planning the trip to getting the destination after the train ride. Then I started to identify the pain points in their journey which was not found in the evaluation of the app.</p>

					<p class="stagger-tween-item">In the heuristic evaluation I found it's hardly possible to plan trips in the app with unresponsive design. Checking live schedule is a big pain point for a lot of riders.</p>

					<p class="stagger-tween-item">From the research I found out most Caltrain riders use Clipper Card as their ticket of choice. However, they can hardly check the balance on the go. It happened to a lot of users I interviewed, that they forgot to tag their cards at the stations sometimes. Adding balance to the card on the machine is not intuitive and takes a very long time.</p>

				<h3 class="valuation stagger-tween-item" style="opacity: 0.6">Station Parking</h3>
				<p class="stagger-tween-item">I never drove to caltrain stations, but quite a few users have expressed the pain with station parking. The designer's conceptual model is to have users park their car first, then remember the number to pay at the kiosks inside the station. Without seeing the guide, users wouldn't know they have to remember the stall number. It's also hard to know where are available spaces to park.</p>

						<p>Parking page also went through a lot of changes. At first the prototype was designed to complete the parking task. When I started testing, I realized there are much more to take into consideration. Where do users park their cars? How do they select stalls? What is the steps they take in real life?</p>

				<h3>REFLECTIONS</h3>
				<p>
					I had a lot of passion towards this project as I really felt there was a need to improve the user experience of the app and provide the services that will make Caltrain riders' life easier.
					<br>
					<br>
					There are a lot of ideas that I don't have time to prototype and give it a try. Some ideas will require a lot more efforts from Caltrain and users, for example, suggesting which train is more crowded, where in the train people should board at certain station, can disabled users require a seat prior to their travel, etc. There are so much we can do to make the Caltrain experience better. If you are also interested and would like to talk to me, please feel free to contact me.
